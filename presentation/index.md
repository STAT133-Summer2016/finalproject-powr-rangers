## Household Income and Burden


```r
clean_years %>% 
  select(zinc2, year, region, fmtburden)%>% 
  filter(fmtburden != ".", fmtburden != "4 No Income") %>% 
  mutate(fmtburden = str_replace(fmtburden, "Greater than 50%", "50% or More")) %>% 
  group_by_("year", "fmtburden") %>%  
  summarise_(new_y = as.formula(
  paste0("~ median(","zinc2", ",na.rm=T)"))) %>% 
  
  
  ggplot(aes_string(x = "year", y = "new_y", color = "fmtburden")) + 
  geom_line(size = 1) + 
  labs(title = "Relationship between Household \nIncome and Burden", 
       y = "Household Income", x = "Year", color = "Burden") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,NA),breaks=c(0,20000,40000,60000),labels=function(x){paste0(x/1000, "K")}) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Dark2") +
  theme_tufte()

## Concluding Thoughts

* Housing Affordability Has Decreased

* The 2007 Housing Bubble Crisis 

* Different Housing Regions Affected Differently 
  
  * Western and Northeast Regions Vs. South and Midwest

---


## Future Questions 

* Does the Data in some graphs keep showing a downward slope? 

* If we analyzed data from 2013 - 2016, would it show another potential, housing housing bubble?

* Our data is limited to 2013, so what is the housing situation most recently?

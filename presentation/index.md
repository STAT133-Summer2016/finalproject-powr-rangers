## Introduction: Motivation and Dataset

* Our data extends from 

* William's cleaning
* Sri's cleaning
* Plots
* Conclusion stuff


---


## Cleaning the Data

Combined Years:

- Dataset is split into fifteen datasets, one for each odd year between 1985 and 2013
- To standardize the data used data from 2003 - 2013
- Reorder the columns to exactly match that of our base (2003 onward)
- Combine every list of datasets into single dataset

Clean Data:

- Initally removed NAs, expressed column in read_csv
- Set column names to lowercase, removed quotations
- Created column for owning and renting data (1= own, 2= rent)
- Write to csv (same for combined years)

## MORE GRAPHS

<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

- Adjusted income per persons
- Bracketed by HUD indexes (0.70 for 1 person, 0.80 for 2, 1.00 for 4)
- Spike around 2010 associated with financial crisis


---


## Median Income Adjusted for Number of Bedrooms By Region


<img src="figure/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Adjusted income per bedroom

Bracketedby HUD indexes (0.70 for 0, 0.90 for 2, 1.04 for 3)

More discrepancy in burden levels between the Midwest/South and Northeast/West 
  
  - Larger homes in the Midwest/South

Purhasing parity shoudl be higher in midwest/south, not expressed in data

---

## Concluding Thoughts

Housing Affordability Has Decreased

The 2007 Housing Bubble Crisis and it's Consequences

Census Regions Differences 
  
  - Western and Northeast Regions Vs. South and Midwest

---


## Future Questions 

* Does the Data in some graphs keep showing a downward slope? 

* If we analyzed data from 2013 - 2016, would it show another potential, housing housing bubble?

* Our data is limited to 2013, so what is the housing situation most recently?

## Introduction: Motivation and Dataset

- Data is chosen from the American Housing Survey (1985 - 2013)

- Burden = Housing Cost Over Monthly Income
  
  - Households with zero/negative income have "-1" in data

- Goal: Housing Affordability 

- Hypothesis: Affordability decreased due to key significant events 
 
- US growing income inequality is indicator of:
  - Housing affordability
  - Shifting income brackets poor and rich
  
- 2007 Housing Market Crash

## Cleaning the Data

Combined Years:

- Dataset is split into fifteen datasets, one for each odd year between 1985 and 2013
- To standardize the data used data from 2003 - 2013
- Reorder the columns to exactly match that of our base (2003 onward)
- Combine every list of datasets into single dataset

Clean Data:

- Initally removed NAs, expressed column in read_csv
- Set column names to lowercase, removed quotations
- Created column for owning and renting data (1= own, 2= rent)
- Write to csv (same for combined years)

## Monthly Housing Costs and Burden 

<img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
- No Income Bracket
  - Not paying for costs
  - Paying with trust funds
- Similar housing costs among burden brackets

---

## Regional Monthly Housing Costs and Burden

- The Northeast impacted first
  - Other regions lagged by two years

## Burden and Median Housing Cost with Assistance
<img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-10" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
- Those needing assitance with reducment of total salary
  - Unemployment 
  - Monetary Crisis 
- High cost brackets = Higher burdens with assistance 
- Less mobility for single families

## Median Income Adjusted by Region

<img src="assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" title="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-11" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

- Adjusted income per persons
- Bracketed by HUD indexes (0.70 = 1 person, 0.80 = 2, 1.00 = 4)
- Spike around 2010

## Median Income Adjusted for Bedrooms By Region

*** =left

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-12](assets/fig/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)


*** =right

- Bracketedby HUD indexes 
  
  - (0.70 for 0, 0.90 for 2, 1.04 for 3)
  
- More discrepancy in burden levels between regions 
  
  - Larger homes in Midwest/South
  
- Purchasing parity higher in midwest/south

## Concluding Thoughts

- Housing Affordability Has Decreased

- The 2007 Housing Bubble Crisis and it's Consequences

- Census Regions Differences 

  - Western and Northeast Regions Vs. South and Midwest
  
## Future Questions / Ask Us Anything


- Do these graphs continue to have decreasing slopes 2014 - Present? 


- If we analyzed data from 2013 - 2016, would it show another potential, housing bubble?

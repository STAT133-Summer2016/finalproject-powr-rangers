This folder contains US housing affordability data from https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/hads/hads.html. The dataset contains a hundred variables and 800 000 observations on housing costs, household incomes and household structures.

The files have been compressed to make it possible to use github for their version control (github has a 100Mb file size limit which is exceeded by our combined dataset). Each compressed package has the dataset year in its name.

Running CleanData.R combines the years to a single file and places this file to ../clean_data. The PDF HADS_documentation has detailed information on all of the variables in the dataset, and should be consulted for further information.
